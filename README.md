# favorite

"favorite" is an app that allows you to sign up, login, retrieve random images from https://unsplash.com/, and choose your favorites!

# Running locally

First, you will need to install `http-server`

Installation via npm:

`npm install http-server -g`

This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line.

After installing, run the following command:

`http-server . -p 8000 -c-1`

You should notice your terminal starting `http-server` and now listening on port 8000. 
Go to `lhttp://localhost:8000/src/app/` and you should be prompted with the initial screen (Sign Up & Login).
